feat: Implement Spec 007 - States (Political System)

Implemented the complete political state system including:

Models:
- Updated State model with new properties (CapitalBurgId, CenterCellId, Pole, Neighbors, etc.)
- Added StateForm enum (Duchy, Kingdom, Empire, Republic, etc.)
- Added StateType enum (Generic, Naval, Lake, Highland, River, Nomadic, Hunting)
- Added DiplomaticStatus enum (Ally, Friendly, Neutral, Rival, Enemy, etc.)
- Added Campaign model for historical military campaigns
- Extended Cell model with StateId, BiomeId, FeatureId, CultureId aliases and CoastDistance

Core Implementation:
- Created StatesGenerator with full state creation and expansion
- Implemented Dijkstra algorithm for territorial expansion with custom cost functions
- Added border normalization to clean up irregular territories
- Implemented diplomacy generation with neighbor relationships
- Added war declaration system with power balance checks
- Implemented state form assignment based on size
- Added statistics collection (area, population, burg count)

Algorithms:
- State creation from capitals with expansionism factors
- Dijkstra expansion with culture, population, biome, height, river, and type costs
- Border normalization to reassign surrounded cells
- Diplomatic relations based on neighbors and geography
- War declaration with campaign generation

Helpers:
- HSL to hex color conversion for state colors
- Weighted random selection for diplomacy
- Gaussian distribution for power balance
- Cost calculation methods for expansion

Tests:
- Created comprehensive StatesGeneratorTests covering:
  - State creation from capitals
  - Capital assignment
  - Territory expansion
  - Statistics calculation
  - Neighbor detection
  - Diplomacy generation
  - State form assignment
  - Color assignment
  - Expansionism factors

Compatibility:
- Fixed MapGenerator to use new State model
- Fixed GeoJsonExporter to use Form instead of Government
- Added MapGenerationSettings properties (SizeVariety, GrowthRate, CurrentYear)

Status: Spec 007 complete and ready for integration
