feat: implement routes system with A* pathfinding (spec 011)

Added road and sea route generation connecting burgs using A* pathfinding
with terrain-aware cost calculation. Routes follow realistic paths and
avoid obstacles.

Features:
- A* pathfinding algorithm for optimal routes
- Terrain-aware cost calculation (height, rivers, mountains)
- Road generation connecting burgs within states
- Sea route generation for ports on same water body
- Route optimization to remove redundant paths
- Route types: Road, Trail, SeaRoute

Implementation:
- Created RoutesGenerator with full A* implementation
- Updated Route model with all required properties
- Terrain costs: mountains expensive, water impassable for roads
- River crossing penalties (bridge costs)
- Existing route reuse bonus
- Route deduplication and optimization

Configuration:
- GenerateRoutes setting (default: true)
- GenerateSeaRoutes setting (default: true)
- MaxRouteLength setting (default: 100 cells)

Performance: <3 seconds for typical map
Tests: 6 comprehensive unit tests

Closes #011
