feat: Implement Spec 008 - Cultures System

Implemented the complete culture system including:

Models:
- Updated Culture model with new properties (CenterCellId, Type, Expansionism, etc.)
- Added CultureType enum (Generic, Naval, Lake, Highland, River, Nomadic, Hunting)
- Added DefaultCulture class for culture definitions
- Removed legacy enums and properties

Core Implementation:
- Created CulturesGenerator with full culture selection, placement, and expansion
- Implemented culture selection from default sets (European, Oriental, HighFantasy, DarkFantasy)
- Added culture center placement with strategic positioning
- Implemented Dijkstra algorithm for culture expansion with custom cost functions
- Added culture type definition based on geography
- Implemented expansionism calculation based on culture type
- Added 3-letter culture code generation

Default Culture Sets:
- Created DefaultCultures static class with 4 culture sets
- European set: 15 cultures (Shwazen, Angshire, Luari, Norse, etc.)
- Oriental set: 13 cultures (Koryo, Hantzu, Yamoto, Turchian, etc.)
- HighFantasy set: 17 cultures (Elfish, Dwarven, Orkish, etc.)
- DarkFantasy set: 7 cultures (Bloodborn, Shadowkin, Voidwalkers, etc.)

Algorithms:
- Culture selection with weighted random based on probability
- Strategic center placement with spacing constraints
- Dijkstra expansion with culture-specific cost functions
- Cost calculation based on biome, height, rivers, and geography
- Statistics collection (area, population, cell count)

Helpers:
- HSL to hex color conversion for culture colors
- Culture score calculation for placement
- Culture code generation with uniqueness check
- Biome, height, river, and type cost functions

Tests:
- Created comprehensive CulturesGeneratorTests covering:
  - Culture creation from defaults
  - Center assignment
  - Territory expansion
  - Statistics calculation
  - Culture type assignment
  - Color assignment
  - Code generation
  - Expansionism factors
  - Different culture sets
  - Name base assignment

Configuration:
- Added MapGenerationSettings properties (CultureCount, CultureSet, NeutralRate)

Status: Spec 008 complete and ready for integration
