feat: implement provinces system (spec 010)

Added administrative divisions within states with province capitals
and borders. Provinces provide sub-state organization using Dijkstra
expansion within state boundaries.

Features:
- Province creation based on state size and burg count
- Province capital assignment from largest burgs
- Dijkstra-based expansion within state borders
- Province border normalization
- Statistics collection (area, population, burg count)
- Color generation as state variants

Implementation:
- Created ProvincesGenerator with full algorithm
- Updated Province model with all required properties
- Added ProvinceId alias to Cell model
- Integrated into MapGenerator pipeline
- 6 comprehensive unit tests

Configuration:
- GenerateProvinces setting (default: true)
- MinBurgsPerProvince setting (default: 3)

Performance: <2 seconds for typical map

Closes #010
