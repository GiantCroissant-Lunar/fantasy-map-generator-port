feat: Implement Spec 009 - Religions System

Implemented the complete religion system including:

Models:
- Created Religion model with all properties (CenterCellId, Type, Expansion, Form, Deities, etc.)
- Added ReligionType enum (Organized, Folk, Cult, Heresy)
- Added ExpansionType enum (Global, State, Culture, Homeland)
- Added Deity model with Name and Sphere
- Extended Cell model with ReligionId property

Core Implementation:
- Created ReligionsGenerator with full religion generation and expansion
- Implemented religion type determination (weighted random)
- Implemented expansion type determination (weighted random)
- Implemented religion form selection (Pantheon, Monotheism, Dualism, etc.)
- Added deity generation based on religion form
- Implemented religion origin placement with spacing constraints

Expansion Algorithms:
- Global expansion: Distance-based probability spreading
- State expansion: Spreads within state borders (90% probability)
- Culture expansion: Spreads within culture borders (80% probability)
- Homeland expansion: Stays near origin (70% probability within radius)

Helpers:
- HSL to hex color conversion for religion colors
- Distance calculation for expansion
- Weighted random selection for types
- Statistics collection (area, population, cell count)

Tests:
- Created comprehensive ReligionsGeneratorTests covering:
  - Religion creation
  - Type assignment (ReligionType and ExpansionType)
  - Deity generation
  - Origin placement
  - Religion expansion
  - Statistics calculation

Configuration:
- Added MapGenerationSettings.ReligionCount property

Integration:
- Added Religions list to MapData

Status: Spec 009 complete - Phase 2A Foundation COMPLETE!
