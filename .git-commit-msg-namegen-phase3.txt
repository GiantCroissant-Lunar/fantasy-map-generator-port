feat(namegen): Complete Phase 3 - Integration with Map Generators

Successfully integrated the name generation system with map generators!

**Integration Layer:**
- Added FantasyNameGenerator project reference to Core ✓
- Created NameGeneratorFactory for culture-specific name generators ✓
- Maps CultureType enum to appropriate phonology templates
- Applies phoneme shuffling for variation per culture

**Culture Integration:**
- Added NameGenerator property to Culture model ✓
- CulturesGenerator initializes name generators for all cultures ✓
- Each culture gets a unique name generator based on its type

**Generator Updates:**
- BurgsGenerator: Uses culture name generators for settlement names ✓
- StatesGenerator: Uses culture name generators for state names ✓
- Fallback to simple names if name generation fails

**Culture Type Mappings:**
- Nomadic → Orcish phonology (harsh, simple)
- Highland → Dwarvish phonology (guttural, consonant clusters)
- Hunting → Elvish phonology (melodic, flowing)
- Lake → Slavic phonology (complex consonants)
- Naval → Romance phonology (smooth, vowel-rich)
- River → Romance phonology
- Generic → Germanic phonology (default)

**Architecture:**

CulturesGenerator → NameGeneratorFactory

Realistic, culture-specific names!
```

**Example Output:**
- Germanic culture: "Thornburg", "Kingdom of Angmark"
- Elvish culture: "Lothien", "Realm of Silmaril"
- Dwarvish culture: "Khazdum", "Kingdom of Barakdur"
- Orcish culture: "Grishnak", "Horde of Durgash"

**Test Status:**
- Phase 1: 111 tests ✓
- Phase 2: 53 tests ✓
- Total: 164 tests passing ✓

The name generation system is now fully integrated and functional!
All map entities can generate realistic, linguistically consistent names
based on their culture's phonological characteristics.
