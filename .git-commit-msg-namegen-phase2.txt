feat(namegen): Add Phase 2 - Grammar Engine & Name Types API

Implemented the grammar and high-level name generation layers:

**Layer 5: Grammar Engine**
- RulePack: RimWorld-style rule expansion with [tag] syntax
- GrammarEngine: Combines static templates with dynamic generators
- Supports recursive rule expansion with depth limiting
- Deterministic with seed support

**Layer 6: Name Types API**
- NameGenerator: High-level API for all name types
- NameType enum: Burg, State, Province, Religion, Culture, Person, River, Mountain, Region, Forest, Lake
- NameTypeTemplates: Predefined grammar templates for each type
- Variety in name generation (simple, compound, affixed patterns)

**Features:**
- Template-based name generation with grammar rules
- Dynamic rule generators for syllables, words, affixes
- Unique name tracking to avoid duplicates
- Customizable templates per name type
- Full integration with Phase 1 layers (syllables, phonology, phonotactics, morphology)

**Test Coverage:**
- RulePackTests: 11 tests for rule expansion
- GrammarEngineTests: 13 tests for grammar engine
- NameGeneratorTests: 18 tests for high-level API
- NameTypeTemplatesTests: 11 tests for templates

**Total Phase 2 Tests:** 53 tests

**Phase 1 + 2 Combined:** 164 tests passing ✓

The name generation system is now complete with all 6 layers functional!
